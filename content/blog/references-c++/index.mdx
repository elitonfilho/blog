## A briefing abount pointers and references
You may already have heard about the term "pointer", specially if you have some background in the C programming language.
Pointer indicates a variable that stores a memory address. In other words, it "points" to the adress of an object. Here is a simple usage example in C++:

```c++
int a = 4;
int* pa = &a; // Address-of operator (&)
std::cout << pa << '\n'; // Prints a memory address. Example: 0x2f14803204482c91
std::cout << *pa << '\n'; // Derreference operator (*), prints the value store in that address (4)
```

Even though it's a quite "simple" concept, mastering its usage is quite difficult and may require an extensive C experience, since pointer arithmethics could easily mislead even the most experienced developers.
If you want to know a bit more about pointers, I recommend [this page](https://en.cppreference.com/book/pointers) for basic concepts and many examples.

In C++, references behave simmilarly to pointers. A reference is an true alias to an existing object in memory, and its type is identified by the ampersand (&) operator.
The compiler will optimize expressions with references, avoiding (most of the times) the copy overhead of assets and using the data referred by the alias.
Some say that "references are like const-pointers that have already been dereferenced". Major differences between pointers and references are:

```c++
// A reference must be initialized when declared
int* pa; // Initialized to random address
// int& ra; // Compile error, references must be initialized
int a = 0;
int& ra = a // OK

// References can not be null
int* pb = NULL; // OK
// int& rb = NULL // Compile error, references must not be null-initialized

// After initialized, references can not refer to another object
int c = 1, d = 2;
int& rc = c;
// rc = d; // Compile error, references can't be reassigned
```

References are safer (hinders the random memory acess of unintialized pointers) and easier to use (no need to use the dereference operator neither the pointer member acess operator (->)), but they are not a full replacement for pointers.
According to the [C++ FAQ](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/references#refs-vs-ptrs), "Use references when you can, and pointers when you have to"!

### References as function parameters
References also bring a major update on how to acess and modify variables, specially outside of its declaration scope.
They are important in any application performance because it provides an alternative to copy parameters in function calls.
Passing arguments to a function is normally done by the pass-by-value mechanims: the function receives a copy the argument, which prevents the modification of the original value.
Modifying the original values would require a variable reassignment from the function return's value, or acessing the variable directly through pointers, which are specially effective because they are very cheap to copy and they usually allow 
the direct manipulation of the memory they point to (exception: pointers to const).
With the pass-by-reference method, arguments corresponding to reference parameters are not copied: such arguments are an alias for the original parameters passed to the function. 

```c++
// Function with string
void tryToModifyString(std::string str) { str = "AnotherString"; };
// Function with string*
void modifyStringWithPointer (std::string* pstr) { *pstr = "StringModifiedWithhPointer"; };
// Function with string&
void modifyStringWithReference(std::string& rstr) { rstr = "StringModifiedWithReference"; };

int main (){
  // Trying to modify strA
  std::string strA = std::string("StringA");
  tryToModifyString(strA);
  std::cout << "Value of strA: " << strA << '\n';
  // Changing strB with pointers
  std::string* strB = &strA;
  modifyStringWithPointer(strB);
  std::cout << "Value of strA: " << *strB << '\n';
  // Changing strA with references
  std::string& rstrA = strA;
  modifyStringWithReference(rstrA);
  std::cout << "Value of strA: " << strA << '\n';
}
```

The program's performance is usually not affected by copping light data types during the function call, such as int or char. But, as you may guess, copying extensive data structures
may hurt the efficiency of C/C++ applications. According to the C++ Core Guidelines, small objects of "up to two or three words" are fine to be passed by value (i.e. copied), but larger 
structures are expensive to copy. Therefore, potentially expensive copies at function parameters should be avoided by using references.

```c++
// Example from the C++ Core Guidelines
void f1(const std::string& s);  // OK: pass by reference to const; always cheap
void f2(std::string s);         // bad: potentially expensive
void f3(int x);            // OK: Unbeatable
void f4(const int& x);     // bad: overhead on access in f4()
```

Reference parameters allows a more elegant syntax but may mask that a function is changing a value. 
That's why some C++ guidelines advise to not use reference to non-const parameters and suggest to use pointers instead. That's maybe a radical suggestion, but it brings a clearer understanding 
about the object's mutation capabilities, specially outside its original scope. A good advice is
> Only change an argument value if it's clear (from the function signature, for example) that you modifying a parameter copy or reference.

### References and implicit conversion
Now that we have some notions of references, we can dig a bit more! In special, i would like to talk about _references behavior on implicit conversions_.
Numeric type conversion can be achived implicitly (by the compiler) or explicitly (by the programmer). Basic numeric type conversions (such as float -> int) are supported by most compilers, but conversion between complex data types should be defined by the developer.

```c++
int integerValue = 1;
double doubleValue = 2;
// C-style casting
double doubleFromInt = (double) integerValue;
// Using a C++ cast
int intFromDouble = static_cast<int>(doubleValue);
// Or using a implicit conversion
float doubleFromIntImplicit = integerValue;
```

In the last example, you could imagine that the conversion is done in two phases: the conversion itself and the binding to a variable. And here is the main catch:

> Implicit conversions generate a _temporary value_ which can not be bound to non-const references.

That would mean that the expression `float& doubleFromIntImplicit = integerValue` is not valid.
The full explanation requires some knowledge of value categories (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/value_category), which i'll write about in the future, but in simple terms, 
C++ does not allow temporary values to be passed to non-const references because it would allow the modification of a object that will be soon destroyed.
The following code explains this effect:

```c++
void modifyValue(double& value) { value++; };
void printValue(const double& value) { std::cout << value << '\n'; };
int main() {
  double doubleValue {1};
  modifyValue(doubleValue); // No implicit conversion, ok
  printValue(doubleValue); // Const reference, ok

  int intValue {1};
  // modifyValue(intValue); // Will not compile because double& can not bind the implicit conversion
  printValue(intValue); // Const reference, ok
}
```
Tip: Use the VSCode C++ extension to capture these errors. The last example produced the following flag: 'a reference of type "double &" (not const-qualified) cannot be initialized with a value of type "int"'


### Summary:
- References creates an alias for a variable. It behaves similarly to pointers, but offers a simpler and safer usage
- Use references on function definitions to avoid parameter copying
- The const modifier is necessary when using references on implicit conversions
